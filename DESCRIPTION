Description:
    scMultiSim simulates paired single cell RNA-seq, single cell ATAC-seq and RNA velocity data,
    while incorporating mechanisms of gene regulatory networks, chromatin accessibility and
    cell-cell interactions. It allows users to tune various parameters controlling the
    amount of each biological factor, variation of gene-expression levels,
    the influence of chromatin accessibility on RNA sequence data, and so on.
    It can be used to benchmark various computational methods for single cell multi-omics data,
    and to assist in experimental design of wet-lab experiments.
